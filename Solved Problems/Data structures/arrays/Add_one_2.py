# This is an alternative solution to the add one problem in the directory.

# ### Problem Statement
# You are given a non-negative number in the form of list elements. For example, the number `123` would be provided as `arr = [1, 2, 3]`. Add one to the number and return the output in the form of a new list. 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# * `input = [1, 2, 3]`
# * `output = [1, 2, 4]`
# 
# 
# **Example 2:**
# * `input = [1, 2, 9]`
# * `output = [1, 3, 0]`
# 
# **Example 3:**
# * `input = [9, 9, 9]`
# * `output = [1, 0, 0, 0]`
