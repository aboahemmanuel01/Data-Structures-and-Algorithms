Problem Definition

Given an integer array, this algorithm finds and return all the subsets of the array. 
The order of subsets in the output array is not important and hence wasn't considered. 
However, the order of elements in a particular subset remains the same as in the input array.

For example:

arr = [9, 9]

output = [[],
          [9],
          [9],
          [9, 9]]
