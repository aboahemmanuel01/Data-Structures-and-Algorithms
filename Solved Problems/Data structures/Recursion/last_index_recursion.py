Problem Definition

Given an array arr and a target element target, this code finds the last index of occurence of target in arr using recursion. 
If target is not present in arr, it returns -1.

For example:
For arr = [1, 2, 5, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4] and target = 5, output = 6
For arr = [1, 2, 5, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4] and target = 7, output = -1
